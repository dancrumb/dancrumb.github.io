<span itemprop="givenName">Dan</span> has had his hands on technology since the tender age of 5, back when 128K memory and 8 bits was all you needed. 
Since then, he's been developing code for a wide variety of platforms in a wide variety of languages. 
His passion for firmware came in 2001 and he can be found inhaling solder fumes and writing micro-processor code when 
he isn't at work inhaling coffee fumes and writing Web Application code.

In addition to that, he's one of the founders of NerdNite in Austin, following a pattern established by Matt Wasowski 
in NYC and Jeremy Kay & Chris Balakrishnan in Boston. You can email him at <span itemprop="email">dancrumb@gmail.com</span>
