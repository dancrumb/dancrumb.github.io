Dan has had his hands on technology since the tender age of 5, back when 128K memory and 8 bits was all you needed. 
Since then, he's been developing code for a wide variety of platforms in a wide variety of languages. 
His passion for firmware came in 2001 and he can be found inhaling solder fumes and writing micro-processor code when 
he isn't at work inhaling coffee fumes and writing Web Application code.

He's one of the founders of preDevCamp,a not-for-profit gathering to develop applications for Palm Pre using both the 
Mojo SDK and traditional web standards.

In addition to that, he's one of the founders of NerdNite in Austin, following a pattern established by Matt Wasowski 
in NYC and Jeremy Kay & Chris Balakrishnan in Boston. You can email him at dancrumb@gmail.com
