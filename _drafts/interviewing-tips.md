# Dan’s Tips on Interviewing

Interviewing candidates is a skill that should be taught more. It’s pretty straightforward in theory: you talk to a candidate and determine whether we should hire them. However, interviewing well is a different matter. Here are my tips on effective interviewing.

## Know what you’re looking for

You need a clear idea of what you’re looking for from the interview. Figure out a few key things and ensure that your list doesn’t overlap too much with another interviewer’s (unless this is desired).

Once you know this, you should direct the interview (as best you can) to provide the candidate with the opportunity to show you this.

## Create an environment to enable the candidate’s best performance

While an interview should be challenging, that challenge should not be caused by poor communication.

Trick questions and gotchas are disrespectful and undermining.

Instead, please ensure the candidate knows that you intend to communicate clearly and that they should ask for any clarification they need. You can always tell them that some particular vagueness is intentional.

## Be explicitly empathetic

Interviews are stressful and artificial. Acknowledge this at the beginning. Remind them that you’ve been where they are... perhaps you even did the same exercise... and that you’re keen to see what they do.

If they show signs of anxiety or being overwhelmed, offer an upbeat recap of what you’ve seen so far. Ask them their next steps; anything you can do to get them out of their head.

## Offer to explain exercises verbally or for them to read the README

Some people absorb information best through reading, others by listening.

Offer those options and let the candidate choose.

NB: Make sure the README covers all the essential points.


## Don’t let candidates get too bogged down

If a candidate seems to be stuck or spiraling, give them a little time to figure their way out. 

If, after a few minutes, they don’t seem to be making progress, ask them what they’re stuck on.

If that doesn’t help, offer them some clues (assuming you can). Provide increasingly direct clues until you are 
at the point where you need to tell them what’s going on.

You will get more out of the interview by getting them over a hump rather than watching them sweat,

Remember that we all get stuck sometimes. Sometimes, it’s on the most ridiculously simple of things.

A candidate’s response to assistance is a valuable data point.

## Help them with syntax derps

If there’s a bug due to mismatched parentheses or a missing closed tag, give them a minute or two to find it.

If they don’t find it, point them at the problem line.

If they still don’t find it, tell them what’s wrong.

That said, don’t tell them about any such mistakes after they make them. If they’re proceeding while there is a syntax error, leave them to it. They may fix it along the way.

Only offer help if they are stuck figuring it out.

## Nudge them away from over-engineering, but don’t prevent it outright

If a candidate is drifting towards over-engineering a solution or unnecessarily expanding the problem's scope, give them a nudge back on track.
Remind them of the limited time available and assure them that “perfectly production ready” is less important than delivering a solution that works.

Don't stop them if they insist on making life difficult for themselves. Ideally, they’ll realize they need to dial it down, but if not, you’ve learned something valuable.

## Nudge them away from effort that you’re not interested in

If a candidate is spending time on something you don’t care about (such as CSS polish), let them know that you're not looking to assess that and that you're happy for them to leave it as is.

As before, if they insist, let them waste their time... it’s also a valuable data point.

## Answer all questions as honestly and candidly as possible

Questions about the company should be answered as honestly as possible.

We’re a startup; things are not perfect. Being honest about our weaknesses will inspire more confidence than pretending we have everything nailed.

Proprietary information should be withheld, but we can answer technical questions at a high level without giving too much away.

If you don’t know the answer to a question, let them know, and then follow up with an email once you have the answer.
